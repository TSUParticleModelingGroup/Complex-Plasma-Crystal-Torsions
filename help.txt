---------------------- Help File for the Complex Plasmas Simulation Program ----------------------

Requirements to Run the Simulation:
- Nvidia CUDA Toolkit: Must be installed.
- GCC/GPP: Required compilers.
- FFMPEG: Needed for video recording and screenshots.

Basics:
- Program Start: The program begins in a paused state, displaying variables in both real-world units
  and program units for verification.
- Starting and Quitting:
  - Press 'r' to unpause and start the simulation.
  - Press 'q' to quit the application.
- Recording and Screenshots:
  - To record videos, press 'm' to start and 'M' to stop recording.
  - To take a screenshot, press 's'.
  - Note: FFMPEG must be installed, or the program will crash when attempting to record.
  - Additional Note: Changing the movie resolution requires modifying the code to adjust the window
    size and recompiling. Refer to the README for more details.

Note on Visual Aids
The magenta-green lines shown in the simulation are a visualization feature used to demonstrate
parent-child relationships, explained in our paper. The magenta color is shown at the parent dust,
and the green line with the arrow end, is at the child dust end. This allows the hierarchical
relationships between the dust to be seen in real-time, and are easily turned off with the other
visual aids via a toggle 'g'.

Complete List of Controls:
- General Controls:
  - 'q' - Quit the application.
  - 'h' - Print this help menu to the console.
  - 'm' - Start recording a movie.
  - 'M' - Stop recording a movie.
  - 's' - Take a screenshot of the simulation window.

- Simulation Controls:
  - 'V' - Increase power on the lower plate.
  - 'v' - Decrease power on the lower plate.
  - 'C' - Increase power on the side cavity.
  - 'c' - Decrease power on the side cavity.
  - 'P' - Increase gas pressure (in milliTorr).
  - 'p' - Decrease gas pressure (in milliTorr).
  - 'I' - Increase BaseIonWakeFractionalCharge.
  - 'i' - Decrease BaseIonWakeFractionalCharge.
  - 'D' - Increase time steps between draws.
  - 'd' - Decrease time steps between draws.

- View Controls:
  - 'w' - Toggle between top and side view.
  - 'o' - Toggle between fulstrum (perspective) and orthographic view.
  - '!' - Recenter the view.

- Camera and Dust Grain Controls:
  - 'e' - Toggle between adjusting the eye (camera) position, dust position, dust velocity, and dust
          diameter (requires dust to be selected).
  - 'x'/'X' - Translate right/left.
  - 'y'/'Y' - Translate up/down.
  - 'z'/'Z' - Translate away from/towards the viewer.

- Simulation Toggles:
  - 'r' - Toggle between running and pausing the simulation.
  - 'f' - Toggle dust freezing on/off (see Dust Grain Selection section for details).
  - 't' - Toggle tracer on/off (shows the path of particles without erasing them each time step).
  - 'a' - Toggle viewing aids on/off (e.g., Debye Length marker, top/bottom boundaries).
  - 'g' - Toggle dust pair viewing on/off (draws a line between dust grains and their companions).

Note: Many of these options are also available through the right-click menu, which provides graphical 
quick-access versions of the toggle controls. The first option in the right-click menu is "Select a dust grain" 
(see Dust Grain Selection below for details).

---------------------- Dust Grain Selection ----------------------

- Selecting a Dust Grain:
  - Right-click on the simulation window and choose "Select a dust grain."
  - Recommendation: Use the '!' control to recenter the view before selecting a dust grain to ensure 
    accurate selection.
  - The program will automatically switch to orthographic mode. Toggle back with 'o' or use the 
    right-click menu to choose "fulstrum."
  - Click on a dust grain to select it. The selected dust will turn blue.
  - Upon selection, the program will remain in the current view, and will remain paused. Pressing 'r'
    will unpause the simulation.

- Adjusting Position, Velocity, and Diameter:
  - Use 'e' or the right-click menu to toggle into dust position adjustment mode.
  - Use the 'x', 'y', and 'z' controls to move the dust grain.
  - Note: Dust will still be affected by forces. Use 'f' to freeze dust movement for free adjustment. 
    This will freeze ALL dust movement.
  - To adjust velocity, toggle with 'e' or use the right-click menu, and the 'x', 'y', and 'z' controls 
    will affect the dust's velocity.
  - To adjust diameter, toggle with 'e' or use the right-click menu. Use the 'x' button or 'X' to decrease 
    or increase the diameter of the selected dust. 'y/Y' and 'z/Z' will do nothing in this mode. 

---------------------- Point Charge Adjustments ----------------------

- Preselect Dust Grains:
  - For experimental purposes, and for visualization of point charge adjustments governed by equations in
    our paper, this mode is included to preselect and lift dust grains using keys '2', '3', and '4'.
  - Press '2' to view two dust grains. The bottom dust grain will be selected by default. Use 'e' or the 
    right-click menu to adjust its position, velocity, or diameter.
  - Keys '3' and '4' will similarly select 3 or 4 dust grains.
  - Note: in each case, all dust grains will be the x-y plane (they will have the same z value, for 
    simplicity).
